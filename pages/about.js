					I am 26 years old self-taught web developer. My goal is to write clean
					and reusable code no matter the size of the project. I think that
					functional website is not enough - it needs to be appeal and live with
					the content.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-4 text-xl text-gray-500">
					Coding is more passion than a work for me. I develop trivial apps in
					my free time to practice new technologies. I follow new trends in web
					industry. Also, i write blog posts about javascript. You can find them
					in blog section.
